    <p>The Redux store is a crucial part of the Redux library, which is a state management tool commonly used with JavaScript applications, particularly in conjunction with frameworks like React. <br>
         The store acts as a centralized container for the application's state and provides a predictable and immutable way to manage and update that state.</p>
