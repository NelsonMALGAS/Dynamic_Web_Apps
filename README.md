**Description**

This is  a JavaScript program that creates a book list application. The application displays books with their corresponding information such as title, author, and description, along with a search feature that allows users to find books by title, author, or genre. The program also allows users to change the theme of the application from light to dark mode. Additionally, users can load more books to the application by clicking the "Show More" button.(IWA19 Final Capstone)

####  NB!! The code provided includes several functions that encapsulate specific functionality and can be considered as a form of abstraction. Each function has a specific purpose and can be called independently to perform a specific task.

This is the further modification of DWA06 so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards.

# DWA08

This is the further modification of DWA06 & 07 so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards and also to make sure that the book preview is Encapsulated properly

# DWA09

This is the further modification of DWA06 ,07 & 08  so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards and also to make sure that the book preview is Encapsulated properly

# DWA10 

This is a Tally count project using strictly the shoelace labrary.When the + button is clicked the number on the display increments by 1,when the - button is clicked the number on the display decrements by 1 and when the reset button is clicked ,it resets the display and displays a message that the counter has been reset

## The two codes demonstrate various array and object manipulation tasks using JavaScript higher Order functions such as forEach, filter, map, reduce, and sort.
 

### The first code(products.js) deals with an array of products. It performs several tasks, including:

Task 1: Console logging each product name using forEach.<br>
Task 2: Filtering out products with names longer than 5 characters using filter.<br>
Task 3: Converting string prices to numbers and removing products without prices using filter and map.<br>
Task 4: Concatenating all product names into a string using reduce.<br>
Task 5: Calculating the highest and lowest-priced items using reduce.<br>
Task 6: Recreating the object with modified keys using Object.entries and reduce.

### The second code(provincesAndNames.js) deals with arrays of provinces and names. It performs the following tasks:

Task 1: Console logging each name using forEach.<br>
Task 2: Console logging each name with its matching province using forEach.<br>
Task 3: Mapping over province names and converting them to uppercase using map.<br>
Task 4: Creating an array with the length of each name using map.<br>
Task 5: Sorting provinces alphabetically using sort.<br>
Task 6: Filtering provinces that don't include the word 'Cape' and getting the count of remaining provinces using filter and length.<br>
Task 7: Using reduce to create an object indicating the province of an individual using names as keys and provinces as values.
