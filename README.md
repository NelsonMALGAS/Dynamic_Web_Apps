**Description**

This is  a JavaScript program that creates a book list application. The application displays books with their corresponding information such as title, author, and description, along with a search feature that allows users to find books by title, author, or genre. The program also allows users to change the theme of the application from light to dark mode. Additionally, users can load more books to the application by clicking the "Show More" button.(IWA19 Final Capstone)

####  NB!! The code provided includes several functions that encapsulate specific functionality and can be considered as a form of abstraction. Each function has a specific purpose and can be called independently to perform a specific task.

# DWA07

This is the further modification of DWA06 so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards.

# DWA08

This is the further modification of DWA06 & 07 so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards and also to make sure that the book preview is Encapsulated properly

# DWA09

This is the further modification of DWA06 ,07 & 08  so that is meets the SOLID Principles standards and also to make sure that the book preview is Encapsulated properly

# DWA10 

This is a Tally count project using strictly the shoelace labrary.When the + button is clicked the number on the display increments by 1,when the - button is clicked the number on the display decrements by 1 and when the reset button is clicked ,it resets the display and displays a message that the counter has been reset
